        "\n",
        "Function: A function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It is defined independently and can be called directly by its name. You can pass arguments to a function, and it may return a value.\n",

        "    # Function body\n",
        "    result = parameter1 + parameter2\n",
        "    return result\n",
        "Using lambda (anonymous functions): Lambda functions are small, anonymous functions defined with the lambda keyword. They can have any number of arguments but only one expression.\n",

        "result = my_function(10, 20) # 10 is assigned to parameter1, 20 to parameter2\n",

        "result = my_function(parameter2=20, parameter1=10)\n",
        "Default Arguments: You can provide default values for parameters in the function definition. If an argument is not provided for a parameter with a default value, the default value is used.\n",

        "-  The return statement in a Python function has one primary purpose:\n",

        "To send a value back from the function to the place where it was called.\n",
        "When a return statement is encountered in a function, the function immediately stops executing, and the value specified after return is sent back as the result of the function call.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a function doesn't have a return statement, or if it has a return statement without a value, it implicitly returns None.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Great question! Iterators and iterables are fundamental concepts in Python when it comes to working with sequences of data. Here's a breakdown of what they are and how they differ:\n",
        "\n",
        "Iterable:\n",
        "\n",
        "An iterable is an object that you can \"iterate\" over. This means you can go through its elements one by one.\n",
        "Examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, dictionaries, and sets.\n",
        "An object is considered an iterable if it has an __iter__() method. This method should return an iterator object.\n",
        "You can use a for loop directly on an iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Absolutely! Generators are a powerful and memory-efficient way to create iterators in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "What are Generators?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are a special type of function that return an iterator. Unlike regular functions that return a single value and then terminate, generator functions use the yield keyword to produce a sequence of values over time. When a generator function encounters a yield statement, it pauses its execution and returns the yielded value. The next time the generator's __next__() method is called, it resumes from where it left off.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes generators ideal for working with large datasets or infinite sequences, as they generate values on the fly rather than storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "How are Generators Defined?\n",
        "\n",
        "Generators are defined like regular functions, but instead of using the return keyword to return a final value, they use the yield keyword one or more times.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a simple example of a generator function that yields a sequence of numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Using generators over regular functions (that return a list or other collection) offers several key advantages, primarily related to memory usage and performance:\n",
        "\n",
        "Memory Efficiency: This is the most significant advantage. Regular functions that return a list or tuple create and store the entire sequence in memory at once. For very large datasets or infinite sequences, this can consume a huge amount of memory and even lead to MemoryError. Generators, on the other hand, generate values on the fly as they are requested using the yield keyword. They only keep track of their current state, so they are very memory efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: Imagine reading a huge file line by line. A function returning a list of all lines would load the entire file into memory. A generator yielding one line at a time would only need to store the current line in memory.\n",
        "Lazy Evaluation: Generators perform lazy evaluation, meaning they only produce the next value when it's explicitly requested (e.g., by calling next() or in a for loop). This is in contrast to eager evaluation, where a regular function computes and returns all values at once. Lazy evaluation can be beneficial when you don't need all the values immediately or if the sequence is very long.\n",
        "\n",
        "Working with Infinite Sequences: Generators are the only practical way to work with infinite sequences in Python. Since they generate values on demand, you can create a generator for an infinite sequence and consume values from it as needed without ever running out of memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: A generator that yields all prime numbers is feasible, while a list containing all prime numbers is not.\n",
        "Improved Performance for Large Datasets: While generating values one by one might seem slower initially, for large datasets, the reduced memory usage and avoidance of creating intermediate data structures can lead to better overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Cleaner Code for Iteration: In some cases, using yield can make the code for creating an iterator more readable and concise compared to manually implementing the __iter__() and __next__() methods for a custom iterator class.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to use Generators:\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with large datasets that won't fit entirely in memory.\n",
        "When you need to generate a sequence of values over time.\n",
        "When dealing with infinite sequences.\n",
        "When you want to improve the memory efficiency of your code.\n",
        "In summary, generators are a powerful tool in Python for creating memory-efficient iterators, especially when dealing with large or infinite sequences. They offer a significant advantage over regular functions that return entire collections by generating values lazily.\n",
        "\n",
        "Would you like me to provide more specific examples of when generators are particularly useful?\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  A lambda function (also known as an anonymous function) is a small, single-expression function that you don't explicitly define using the def keyword. It's created using the lambda keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic syntax is:\n",
        "\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "lambda: The keyword used to create a lambda function.\n",
        "arguments: Zero or more arguments that the lambda function can take (similar to parameters in a regular function).\n",
        "expression: A single expression whose result is implicitly returned by the lambda function\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Absolutely! Let's explore the purpose and usage of the map() function in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "Purpose of map()\n",
        "\n",
        "The map() function is a built-in Python function that is used to apply a given function to each item of an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and return an iterator of the results. It provides a concise way to perform the same operation on multiple elements without writing an explicit for loop in many cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "Usage of map()\n",

        "The basic syntax of map() is:\n",
        "\n",
        "map(function, iterable)\n",
        "function: The function that you want to apply to each item of the iterable. This function should take one argument.\n",
        "iterable: The sequence (like a list, tuple, string, etc.) whose elements you want to process.\n",
        "map() returns a map object, which is an iterator. To get the results as a list, tuple, or other sequence, you need to convert the map object using functions like list(), tuple(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
        "\n",

        "reduce()\n",
        "\n",
